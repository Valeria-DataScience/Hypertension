## Hypertension
# A multivariate study of ambulatory factors associated with hypertension in adults

**Clinical background**
Arterial hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a condition associated with a high risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and kidney disease. Blood pressure (BP) levels follow a finely regulated cycle, influenced by both exogenous factors (e.g., activity, stress, and posture throughout the 24 hours) as well as endogenous circadian rhythms of the nervous and autocrine systems.

In healthy conditions, BP levels decrease ≥ 10% during the night compared to the day. An individual with this pattern is classified as a dipper. However, when there is little or no decrease in BP at night, individuals are classified as nondippers.

This latter condition has clinical concern in hypertensive patients, because a constant exposure to high BP levels is associated to an increased risk of organ damage and decreased renal and cardiovascular function.



Dipper vs. Nondipper Classification from Ambulatory BP Data

This project analyzes ambulatory blood pressure data to classify patients as dippers or nondippers, based on the variation of blood pressure during nighttime — a clinically significant indicator of cardiovascular risk.

**Context**
The dataset comes from the Unit of Preventive Medicine at a public hospital in Paris, France, and includes:

24-hour blood pressure recordings
Arterial stiffness parameters (e.g., Pulse Wave Velocity, AASI)
Vascular compliance
Demographic information

**Goal**
The main objective is to explore circadian blood pressure patterns and develop a classification model to identify patients at higher cardiovascular risk due to a nondipper profile.

**Tools & Technologies**
Python (Google Colab)
pandas & numpy for data manipulation
matplotlib for visualization
scikit-learn for preprocessing and machine learning
