## Hypertension
# A multivariate study of ambulatory factors associated with hypertension in adults

Arterial hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a condition associated with a high risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and kidney disease. Blood pressure (BP) levels follow a finely regulated cycle, both by exogenous factors (e.g., activity, stress, and posture throughout the 24 hours) and endogenous circadian rhythms in the nervous and autocrine systems.

In healthy conditions, BP levels decrease â‰¥ 10% during the night compared to the day. An individual with this pattern is classified as a dipper. However, when there is little or no decrease in BP at night, individuals are classified as nondippers.

This latter condition is of significant clinical concern in hypertensive patients, given that constant exposure to high BP levels is associated with an increased risk of organ damage and decreased renal and cardiovascular function.

Ambulatory BP monitoring and determination of arterial mechanical properties play an important role in identifying patients at cardiovascular risk. Some parameters are pulse wave velocity (PWV), which is an independent index that predicts arterial stiffness, as well as an ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI), among others.
